prototype
---------
the "prototype" generally represents model of the object (structure), which contains list of
properties and methods of the object.
“prototype” is a predefine attribute.

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:
    * Student objects inherit from Student.prototype
    * Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
    * Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:
Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

Adding Properties and Methods to Objects:
Sometimes you want to add new properties or methods to an existing object literal of a given type.
Sometimes you want to add new properties or methods to an object constructor.
